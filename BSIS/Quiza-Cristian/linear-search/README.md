Linear Search
=======================

## Description

- LINEAR SEARCH checks each item in a collection from the start to end until a match is found.
-  It's worse case algorithmic time complexity is LINEAR or O(n).

## To Do:

- Accepts keyboard input to set size of array.
- Generate random numbers to array accordingly.
- Accepts keyboard input to search for a number.
- Show search result if number is found and what index position.

## Pseudocode:

    START PROGRAM
    
     FOR each number IN array
      IF array[i] == search
         PRINT FOUND at array[i]
      ELSE
         PRINT NOT FOUND
    
    END PROGRAM
