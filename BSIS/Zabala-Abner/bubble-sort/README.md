=======================

## Description

 - BUBBLE SORT is based on the idea of repeatedly comparing pairs of adjacent elements, then switching positions if they exist in the wrong order.
 - It's worse case algorithmic time complexity is QUADRATIC or O(n^2).

## To Do:

- Accepts keyboard input to set size of array.
- Generate random numbers to array accordingly.
- Show unsorted random numbers.
- Show sorted numbers after.

## Pseudocode:

    START PROGRAM
    
     FOR each number IN array
      IF array[i] > array[i+1]
         swap([i], array[i+1])
    
    END PROGRAM
